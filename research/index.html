									<h3><strong>A surrogate-based optimal likelihood function for the Bayesian calibration of catalytic recombination in atmospheric entry protection materials</strong></h3>

									<li><p>Engineers still grapple with understanding the physical phenomena involved during the atmospheric entry of space capsules. So far, this severe lack of knowledge has been overcome in practice by over-doing safety measures, not too engineering-like if you ask me. Since the 60s, the community has been trying to gather knowledge on what happens to the space vehicle’s surface when it enters dense planetary atmospheres. We still don’t have a comprehensive answer but we are better suited to understand it. The problem is that many things happen at the same time. It is difficult (at least with current technology) to test each little phenomena occurring during entry separately or even to design tests where you isolate one effect: thermal behavior of the gas, chemistry, etc. 

									When we test to learn things about this phenomena, we can only measure things that are a final effect of a bunch odifferent things. If you want to learn about chemical reactions in the gas, you have to assume many things about thagas, the experimental data is not enough. This way, you will always get partial understanding and highly dependent on the assumptions made and conditions tested. The work I present here LINK contains 3 different contributions for the community:

									1) The 2 most immediate causes that could explain the experiments on reusable protection materials are considered not known at the same time, even though we only want to learn about one of them. We need this in order not to bias the result with a hard assumption.

									2) The cause we are not interested in (contribution of the convective heat flux to the overall heat flux the protection material experiences) it’s limited to its most likely values thanks to the mathematical framework we developed, reducing the uncertainty on the cause we are interested in (contribution of the diffusive heat flux).

									3) We show that it’s possible to improve the experiments in a plasma wind tunnel to increase our certainty about the value of the parameter of the cause we are interested in, vital for the community as it’s embedded in all CFD simulations of this kind.

									This contribution is only an idea in a very promising research direction that we are exploring in my PhD. Stay tuned! More is coming!
