									<li><p>I took part on the organization of last year's festival in Brussels. I was part of the Atoms to Galaxies team. As team members, our duties consist of finding a venue for the 3-days event, finding sponsorship for renting the place and all the material needed and engaging interesting speakers in the field.
									In our event, we invited 6 speakers (2 per day) ranging from professors to researchers and PhD students from <a href="https://www.vub.be/">VUB</a> and <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">ULB</a> Universities in Brussels. I had the enormous privilege to help prepare some of the speakers' presentations by giving them insights into what to expect from a general audience. The topics we covered last year ranged from Cosmology to Standard Particle Physics and beyond: black holes, neutrinos, quarks, strings...
									The team is also in charge of organizing activities for the interval between talks. We put together live quizzes on the relevant scientific topics. The general feedback was very good and I'll be supporting this year's activities as well.</h3>
